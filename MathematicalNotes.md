## Count the digits
for counting the digits the trick is to divide the number by 10 and update the number till number becomes Zero.

for Example:
    Count the number of digits in 345
    1. divide 345 by 10 and count++   Number: 345 Count : 1
    1. 34 by 10 and count++     Number:34 Count:2
    1. 3 by 10 and count++     Number:3 Count:3
    1.  Now 3 by 10 is 0 so we stop the loop
